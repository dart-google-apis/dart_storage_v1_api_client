Adding dependency to pubspec.yaml

```
  dependencies:
    google_storage_v1_api: '>=0.4.0'
```

For web applications:

```
  import "package:google_storage_v1_api/storage_v1_api_browser.dart" as storageclient;
```

For console application:

```
  import "package:google_storage_v1_api/storage_v1_api_console.dart" as storageclient;

Working without authentication the following constructor can be called:

```
  var storage = new storageclient.Storage();
```

To use authentication create a new `GoogleOAuth2` object and pass it to the constructor:


```
  GoogleOAuth2 auth = new GoogleOAuth2(CLIENT_ID, SCOPES);
  var storage = new storageclient.Storage(auth);
```
